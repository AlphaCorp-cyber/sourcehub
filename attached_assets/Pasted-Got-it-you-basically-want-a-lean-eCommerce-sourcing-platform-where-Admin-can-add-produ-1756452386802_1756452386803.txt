Got it ✅ — you basically want a **lean eCommerce / sourcing platform** where:

* Admin can add products (with images, description, price, etc.).
* Customers can browse products and buy directly.
* Customers can also **request a product** (custom order) → admin responds with feedback & pricing.
* Payments go through **Stripe**.
* Has a **modern landing page** + **customer sign-in/sign-up**.
* UX should stay **simple and intuitive** (not bloated like typical big eCommerce).

Here’s how I’d recommend structuring it:

---

### 🔹 System Features

**1. Landing Page (Frontend)**

* Hero section (clear “Shop from China, hassle-free”).
* Showcase of featured products.
* How it works (Buy, Request, Get Delivered).
* Testimonials (optional).
* Call to action → "Shop Now" / "Request Product".

**2. Customer Module**

* Sign up / Login (Google or email).
* Browse products added by admin.
* Add to cart & checkout with Stripe.
* “Request Product” form → enter link, description, budget → admin responds.
* Order history & status tracking.

**3. Admin Module**

* Login to dashboard.
* Add/edit/delete products.
* Manage customer product requests → reply with quote (auto-email notification to user).
* View orders & mark statuses (e.g., Pending, Paid, Shipped).

**4. Payment & Notifications**

* Stripe integration for checkout.
* Email/SMS notifications on order status.
* Admin notification when a new request is submitted.

---

### 🔹 Tech Stack (Simple but Scalable)

* **Frontend:** Next.js (React) + TailwindCSS → fast & modern UI.
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express or NestJS) OR Laravel (if you prefer PHP).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL (or Firebase if you want simplicity).
* **Authentication:** JWT / Firebase Auth / NextAuth (for simplicity).
* **Payments:** Stripe Checkout.
* **Hosting:**

  * Vercel (for frontend).
  * Render / Railway / DigitalOcean (for backend + DB).

---

### 🔹 Development Roadmap (Minimal Viable Product)

1. **Landing Page + Auth**

   * Build clean homepage.
   * Implement customer sign up / login.

2. **Product Catalog**

   * Admin adds products.
   * Customers can view & search products.

3. **Cart & Checkout**

   * Add to cart.
   * Stripe checkout (with success & cancel pages).

4. **Product Request Flow**

   * Request form for customer.
   * Admin responds (stored in system + email sent).

5. **Admin Dashboard**

   * Manage products, orders, requests.

---

### 🔹 UI/UX Style

* Minimalist design (like **Shopify storefronts**).
* Use soft colors, rounded cards, lots of whitespace.
* Keep checkout flow **1–2 steps max**.

👉 Question for you before I draft code / structure:
Do you want me to **prepare a full starter project** (e.g., Next.js + Stripe + simple admin), or do you want a **step-by-step guide** where you build it yourself piece by piece?
